:name: Razorpay
:location: Bengaluru, KA, India
:description: India's leading financial platform for all things payments & banking…
:batch: W15
:industry:
- Fintech
- Payments
:extended_description: "The journey of building the ecosystem from scratch started
  in 2014, when Harshil Mathur (CEO & Co-Founder) and Shashank Kumar (MD & Co-Founder)
  \ were working on a crowdfunding portal project for India, they soon realized that
  most of the online payment gateway solutions were extremely cumbersome to get started
  on, especially for startups and SMEs. The company was surprised to see that the
  simple process of accepting payments was not streamlined. So they went about building
  an ecosystem from scratch with a hyperfocus on making the lives of businesses simpler
  and that's how Razorpay was born. The company witnessed the dismal state of the
  online payments industry in India and understood that they have a larger and more
  important issue to solve - democratizing payments for Indian businesses, particularly
  the underserved market, the SMEs. Razorpay today powers online payments for 34 of
  the 42 startups in India that became unicorns in 2022. \r\n\r\nRazorpay enables
  payments and banking solutions for over 10Mn businesses, including the likes of
  Facebook, Airtel, Lenskart, Mirae Asset Capital markets, Indian Oil, National Pension
  Scheme, TataConsultancy Services, Swiggy, CRED, BookMyShow, Ola, Zomato, Swiggy,
  ICICI Prudential among others. The core premise of the vision and values that Razorpay
  was founded in 2014 is the same as the organization practices today. It is to make
  money movement simpler and easier. Razorpay is on the path of building the Central
  Nervous System of Digital India, the next-gen payments and banking infrastructure
  for Digital India. The company will continue building an ecosystem that will not
  just build intelligent products that will make the lives of businesses easy and
  efficient but also drive financial growth and innovation for small businesses. All
  this is being done, together, in collaboration with banks, regulators, and stakeholders
  so that India can build a better place for doing business.\r\n\r\nRazorpay’s valuation
  jumped from $1 billion to $7.5 billion in just 14 month in 2021 and has added a
  host of marquee investors to its captable. Razorpay is also the second Indian company
  to be a part of Silicon Valley’s largest tech accelerator, Y Combinator. Marquee
  investors such as Lone Pine Capital, Alkeon Capital, TCV, GIC, Tiger Global, Sequoia
  Capital India, Ribbit Capital, Matrix Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Y Combinator,
  and MasterCard have invested a total of $741.5 Mn through Series A, B, C, D, E and
  F funding. The last financing round of Series F led the company’s valuation to $7.5
  Billion signaling one of the fastest increases in valuation for an Indian Unicorn.
  Razorpay plans to further scale up its Business Banking Suite, RazorpayX, and again
  build new banking solutions in 2023 that will help businesses focus less on handling
  compliance, operations and more on growth.\r\n\r\nThis commitment to make lives
  simpler will continue at a much deeper level now, thanks to the opportunity to make
  acquisitions with like-minded companies.  In total, till date, Razorpay has made
  seven acquisitions over the course of time: \r\n\r\nAcquired Ezetap in 2022 - India’s
  leading offline POS company, PoshVine in 2022 - India’s leading fintech startup
  that provides payments-linked loyalty solutions to payment networks, banks, and
  businesses, IZealiant in 2022 - A mobile-first, API-enabled, and cloud-ready payment
  solution and made its first international foray in South-East Asia by announcing
  its acquisition of Curlec in 2022 - A Recurring revenue platform. TeraFin Labs in
  2021 - the AI-based SaaS platform that facilitates digital financing solutions.
  \ RazorpayX Payroll in 2019 - a Payroll and HR Management Software company, to solve
  for seamless automation of a business’s entire payroll process, and Thirdwatch in
  2019 - an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven company specializing in big data and
  machine learning for real-time fraud prevention. \r\n\r\nCustomer has always been
  at the core of all disruption that the company does, from addressing evolving needs
  to delivering new solutions:\r\n\r\n- This hyperfocus helped bring Razorpay’s several
  Industry first innovation into the market since 2014. Razorpay became the first
  to launch completely digital on-boarding process for startups, first to launch support
  for UPI, first to launch support for Bharath QR, first to introduce recurring payments
  for businesses through Razorpay Route, automating payment receipts and later automating
  payouts and making the entire process seamless and optimized and many more were
  introduced aling the way. Other firsts include:\r\n\r\n- First to launch India’s
  Multi-Network Tokenisation solution, TokenHQ \r\n- Razorpay became India’s first
  payment gateway to support credit cards on UPI\r\n- Razorpay also became India’s
  largest omnichannel payment gateway for businesses post acquiring Ezetap which is
  India’s leading offline POS company that was founded with the aim to simplify the
  in-person offline payments experience. \r\n- Razorpay expanded health insurance
  policy to include LGBTQIA+ and Live-In Partners- This industry-first move made Razorpay
  the first Fintech unicorn in India to introduce a thoughtfully diverse and highly
  inclusive insurance policy for its team members. The new insurance policy, introduced
  recently, is applicable to all current team members of Razorpay."

  think biologists should have robots to do pipetting for them. People doing science
  should be free of tedious benchwork and repetitive stress injuries. They should
  be able to spend their time designing experiments and analyzing data.\r\n\r\nThat's
  why we started Opentrons.\r\n\r\nWe make robots for biologists. Our mission is to
  provide the scientific community with a common platform to easily share protocols
  and reproduce each other's results. Our robots automate experiments that would otherwise

  security foundation.\r\n\r\nFrom our early days of automating security monitoring
  for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001, to pioneering a brand-new

  internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security remains
  unchanged. Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time
  check— is essential. Vanta is the leading Trust Management Platform that helps simplify
  and centralize security for organizations of all sizes. Over 4,000 companies including
  Autodesk, Chili Piper, Flo Health and Quora, rely on Vanta to build, maintain and
  demonstrate their trust—all in a way that's real-time and transparent.\r\n\r\nRecently
  named the #1 Leader in G2's Winter 2023 Grid® Reports for Security Compliance, Vanta
  debuted a number of new product innovations over the last year, including Access
  Reviews which automates the once-manual, time-consuming access reviews process and
  an enhanced Risk Management solution allowing companies to holistically understand,

:extended_description: "Ophelia helps people quit opioids without going to rehab.
  We offer online doctor’s visits, withdrawal medication prescriptions, and support
  for long-term recovery, using a protocol 6x more effective than most rehabs (2/3rds
  of which don't have doctors).\r\n\r\nMore than 3 million Americans are addicted
  to opioids, but 80% are not getting help, due to jobs, families, and privacy concerns.
  Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and
  it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment
  for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special
  waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult
  to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't
  doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1
  cause of death for Americans under 50.\r\n\r\nOphelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine,
  using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market
  in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it.
  We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.\r\n\r\nZack started
  Ophelia after losing his girlfriend to an opioid overdose, who found it easier to
  get medication from a drug dealer than a doctor. We are raising money to help patients
  in waiting, grow our footprint, save lives, and earn venture-level returns for investors."

:extended_description: "Recurrency is reversing enterprise resource planning (ERP)
  stagnation by building the industry-standard ERP automation platform: blazingly
  fast and complete with powerful automation tools like intelligent sales recommendations,
  dynamic pricing, and demand forecasting. Despite distribution being a multi-trillion
  dollar industry, the legacy ERP systems that exist to help businesses manage their
  purchasing, inventory, sales, order processing, and accounting are decades behind.
  \r\n\r\nFor the most part, ERP systems are painfully slow, difficult to use, and
  soul-crushingly manual. Using Recurrency can boost a distributor’s revenue and profit
  margins, while reducing waste and saving time. Most importantly, Recurrency is fully
  integrated with the customer’s legacy system, so deploying Recurrency in production
  can be done in as little as one day."

:extended_description: "Lawdingo gets people in touch with a lawyer very quickly.\r\n\r\nLawdingo
  gives people seeking legal services direct access to independent lawyers who can
  help them. Such attorneys usually have more flexible hours, lower rates, and greater
  interest in customer service than to their larger firm counterparts. The problem
  is that there is so many such lawyers; how is someone supposed to figure out who
  is right for them, and who has some time to take on their case? Fair question. Coincidentally,
  we started Lawdingo to answer just that. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a lawyer,
  we encourage you to try finding an easier way to get one to work for you. If you
  are a lawyer working in solo or small practice, we encourage you to find a more
  effective way to grow your law practice. \r\n\r\nWe also encourage you not to take
  our word for it. Read what Solo Practice University, the ABA Journal, FindLaw, AboveTheLaw,
  TechCrunch, Lifehacker, and others say about us. This isn't some fly-by-the-night
  company. This is the future of the legal industry. We hope you'll get in touch.
  \r\n\r\nLawdingo was started by Nikhil Nirmel (nikhil@lawdingo.com), an entrepreneur
  with a background at Yelp and Wharton Undergrad, and Dan Langevin , a ridiculously
  talented technologist who was formerly CTO of Lifebooker. Lawdingo has backing from

  different brands have different sizing standards, making shopping difficult--many
  men must shop in 4 - 5 different stores before finding a shirt that actually fits!
  By providing a home try on program and giving the ability to make custom fit adjustments
  to all of their apparel, Vastrm allows its customers to finally hone in on and find
  the perfect fit for their unique body types.\r\n\r\nTang came up with the idea for
  Vastrm, which is a Sanskrit word for cloth, when a customer told him he had purchased
  a perfect shirt in Italy and has never been able to find the same fit again. He
  was considering flying back to Italy to track the shirt maker down, but Jonathan
  managed to adjust Vastrm shirts to the same fit."

:extended_description: "Orbio uses satellite imagery to track methane emissions from
  the oil & gas industry. We sell the data to financial companies that want to invest
  into the best performing energy companies.\r\n\r\nUntil today, oil & gas companies
  use excel-based emission factors to calculate and report their emissions. As these
  excel-based emission factors underestimate actual emissions by ~70%, the finance
  companies that invest into oil & gas can’t mitigate against incoming risks from
  new regulations, \r\n\r\nWe have built a technology that can for the first time
  use satellite images to track methane from every single oil & gas facility on the
  planet, replacing emission factors and allowing finance companies to make the best
  bets on oil & gas companies that will withstand a wide avalanche of incoming regulation.
  In the summer 2023 our satellite-based technology got ranked #1 both in terms of
  accuracy and sensitivity of methane emission events by Stanford University in a
  peer-reviewed study, beating a range of multi-bn dollar competitors like Maxar.\r\n\r\nLearn

  complications (like postpartum hemorrhage, preeclampsia/eclampsia, emergency c-section,
  preterm labor, and more) as soon as the first visit. We automatically analyze relevant
  demographic and clinical risk factors, flag high-risk patients, and provide evidence-based
  interventions, giving doctors months in advance to intervene and prevent complications
  from ever happening.\r\n\r\nOur global clinical studies have shown that we can catch
  2-3x more complications than clinical judgment 10x sooner."
